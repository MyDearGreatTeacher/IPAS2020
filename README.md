Building from those standards, guidelines, and practices, the Framework provides a common taxonomy and mechanism for organizations to:
1) Describe their current cybersecurity posture;
2) Describe their target state for cybersecurity;
3) Identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement within the context of a continuous and repeatable process;
4) Assess progress toward the target state;
5) Communicate among internal and external stakeholders about cybersecurity risk.
